        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Although the origins of sugar cane have been debated by historians and agriculturalists, there are a few hypotheses. Some have linked its origins to the migrations of settlers from Indo-china across southern paciﬁc land bridges through new guinea, where the original cuttings were found and spread across the rest of the paciﬁc islands. Anoth- er source attributes it to early Arab traders who brought cuttings from the Celebes and planted them in Mindanao, where our distillery resides. Others have linked the cuttings origins directly to the Philippines and parts of Africa. Regardless of from where it’s true origins stem, we are an important part of the narrative that is the ancestry of cane.</p>
        <p>All of this dating as far back as 600 BC, well over a millennium before ﬁnding its way to the new world that was 16th century Europe and its commercial cultivation. Fast forward to the present and we are still one of the top producers of cane globally.</p>
        <p>Rum is integral to the Philippine narrative. We are the second largest consumer of Rum in the world. Catering to the everyday drinker, the market conditions dictate high volume production of our proud local spirits. We want to change that. Over 40 years ago, John Perrine, spirit enthusiast, Rainforest conservator and one of our founding members, felt the need for that change. He took commercially produced rum and ﬁltered it through locally sourced, steam activated coco husk charcoal. He then aged it in freshly dumped bourbon barrels. Soon enough, the new rum was sought after. Until this day, the Philippines didn’t produce any sort of craft, small batch, or ultra premium rum. We at Rainforest Distillers decided to capitalize on this gap in the market by producing an honest, superior quality, and excellent tasting rum—the ﬁrst and only Philippine Agricole. </p>

        <h2>Pure Rhum Agricole</h2>
        <p>Rhum Agricole or Agricultural Rum is naturally made from sugarcane juice, unlike conventional rum, also known as Rhum Industriel - which is made from molasses.</p>
        <p>Not only is an Agricole harder to produce consistently, it requires a close proximity to the cane itself. Once the cane is cut, it begins to ferment through the natural yeasts found in the grass, thus needing to be pressed, pitched and sealed as soon as possible to avoid a tainted fermentation. Unless the distillery is beside the cane ﬁelds you can’t actually produce an Agricole at this quality. </p>
        <p>Pure sugarcane juice, being the most raw form of rum’s possible feedstocks, distills into a dynamic and delicate spirit. Agricole is considered a rum of the highest quality and is known for its colorful complexities - widely regarded as an expression of rum in its purest form. RAINFOREST DISTILLERS, INC. Our Rhum is made from 100% pure sugar cane juice, harvested, washed and pressed fresh from the ﬁelds.</p>

        <p>We only use one variety of sugarcane for our product, thus utilizing it’s rich ﬂavor in it’s purest. When these region speciﬁc ﬂavors are isolated it makes for a uniquely fresh and balanced ﬁnal product unlike any other in the market.</p>
        <p>Unblended with any concentrate or byproduct, the outcome is a craft Rhum of unparalleled quality.</p>
