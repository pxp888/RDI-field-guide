        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Although the origins of sugar cane have been debated by historians and agriculturalists, there are a few hypotheses. Some have linked its origins to the migrations of settlers from Indo-china across southern paciﬁc land bridges through new guinea, where the original cuttings were found and spread across the rest of the paciﬁc islands. Anoth- er source attributes it to early Arab traders who brought cuttings from the Celebes and planted them in Mindanao, where our distillery resides. Others have linked the cuttings origins directly to the Philippines and parts of Africa. Regardless of from where it’s true origins stem, we are an important part of the narrative that is the ancestry of cane. All of this dating as far back as 600 BC, well over a millennium before ﬁnding its way to the new world that was 16th centu- ry Europe and its com- mercial cultivation. Fast forward to the present and we are still one of the top producers of cane globally.</p>
