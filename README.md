## Field guide for potential investors

This website is an online version of a pitch document we created in 2018 for a startup rum distillery, which has been a growing project since 2013.  

We were seeking funding at the time, and prepared several documents to support that, but we did not create any online resources at that time.  

Hopefully that will change in the future!

___(Update : The company is in production, and the first batch of rum will be bottled in late 2023!)___

The website is a obviously a work-in-progress, but will improve as I do.  
(disclosure: I am one of four partners in this distillery.)
