## Field guide for potential investors

  

This website is an online version of a pitch document we created in 2018 for a startup rum distillery, which has been a growing project since 2013.

  

We were seeking funding at the time, and prepared several documents to support that, but we did not create any online resources at that time.

  

Hopefully that will change in the future!

  

___(Update : The company is in production, and the first batch of rum will be bottled in late 2023!)___

  

The website is a obviously a work-in-progress, but will improve as I do.

(disclosure: I am one of the partners in this distillery.)

## Next steps
The content for this site was generated in 2018, at a time when the primary goal was to secure funding for production.  As this has been accomplished, the content has to be updated with marketing material as a priority.  

The creation of marketing materials and design choices are still in progress, but will hopefully be finalized soon.
