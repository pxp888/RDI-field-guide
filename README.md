## Field guide for potential investors

  

This website is an online version of a pitch document we created in 2018 for a startup rum distillery, which has been a growing project since 2013.

  

We were seeking funding at the time, and prepared several documents to support that, but we did not create any online resources at that time.

  

Hopefully that will change in the future!

  

___(Update : The company is in production, and the first batch of rum will be bottled in late 2023!)___

  

The website is a obviously a work-in-progress, but will improve as I do.

(disclosure: I am one of the partners in this distillery.)

# Design
The site has a consistent color theme that is a tinted monotone with a single highlight color.  

# Features
There are four static site pages, Home, Introduction, Marketing Direction, and Branding. 
Lastly there is a contact page for receiving messages.  

## Header
There is a consistent header at the top of each page.  This shows the company name and logo at the top, and a navigation bar below that.  
The navigation links react to mouse hovering, and the current page is indicated by a highlight color with partial opacity.

*For example, the image above shows the header when looking at the contact page of the site.*

## Homepage
The homepage is largely a single image, which has a slow zoom effect (taken from the "love running" example website).  
There are some short textual descriptions of the product.

## Introduction, Marketing Direction, and Branding Pages

These are all static pages with relevant information presented.  

## Contact page
The final site page is a contact page for receiving messages.

## Footer
Lastly, we have a consistent footer throughout the site.  This simply shows social media links, along with a copyright notice.  

# Screen Size considerations
The use of wrapping flexbox containers allowed for minimal adjustments for smaller screens.  A single CSS media query with four lines of adjustments are required to maintain readability on smaller screens.

# Sources used
### "Love Running" example code
The code for the display of images, and the captioning on top of them was inspired by the "Love Running" example code from Code Institute.  

### Site Design source material
The source material for the site was from a PDF document created by Marc Schulze, the general manager of Rainforest Distillery, Inc.  I did have personal input on the original document, but the vast majority of the content and credit for said content is due to Marc Schulze.  

This site was created with his permission and support.
